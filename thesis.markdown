Here you can find the preliminary chapters of my PhD thesis:
- [Chapter 2](/assets/thesis/chapter2.pdf): The impact of the observed baryon distribution in haloes on the total matter power spectrum
- [Chapter 3](/assets/thesis/chapter3.pdf): How baryons can significantly bias cluster count cosmology
- [Chapter 4](/assets/thesis/chapter4.pdf): Why are we still using 3D masses for cluster cosmology?
- [Chapter 5](/assets/thesis/chapter5.pdf): Galaxy cluster aperture masses are more robust to baryonic effects than 3D halo masses
