In this paper, we use a phenomenological halo model to make physically
and observationally motivated predictions of the matter clustering on
large scales. Assuming that all matter in the Universe is contained in
dark matter haloes, we can predict the clustering of matter in the
Universe once we know how these haloes cluster and how the matter
inside the haloes is distributed.

The large-scale clustering of haloes can be accurately predicted using
gravity-only simulations. However, the matter distribution inside the
haloes will behave differently due to galaxy formation processes which
we cannot predict from first principles. We constrained the matter
distribution inside the haloes using observations of gas inside
clusters and groups of galaxies. This allows us to make
observationally motivated predictions for the change in the clustering
of matter on large scales due to baryonic processes, without having to
use hydrodynamical simulations that need to resort to uncertain
subresolution (so-called "subgrid") recipes for the effects of galaxy
formation.

We showed for the first time, independently of hydrodynamical
simulations, that these galaxy formation processes do result in a
significant change in the clustering of matter on very large scales
compared to a gravity-only Universe. Importantly, this change is
dominated by the less massive groups of galaxies, whose gas content we
cannot probe as well as that of behemoth clusters. We also showed that
the outer distribution of gas, which we cannot yet constrain
observationally, can change the matter clustering by up to 10%.
