Hi! My name is Stijn Debackere.

I am a [de Sitter][leiden-de-sitter] fellow at [Leiden
Observatory][leiden-observatory], working with [Joop
Schaye][joop-schaye] and [Henk Hoekstra][henk-hoekstra]. 

I am a cosmologist, which means I try to study the Universe: what is
it made up of and how does it evolve. It turns out that when we know
the composition, it is "easy" to predict the evolution (easy means
that [General
Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) can tell
us). I study how matter evolves through cosmic time using large
agglomerations of galaxies, called galaxy groups and galaxy clusters.
Their mass and how it is distributed, as well as how many of them we
can find, contains a wealth of information about the cosmology of the
Universe. For a layman's introduction to my research, look [here]({%
